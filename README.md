**Raven** is a modern programming language and experimental compiler inspired by the [.NET Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) architecture.

‚ú® **Key traits**:
- **Familiar yet fresh syntax** ‚Äî looks like Swift, with ideas borrowed from Rust, F#, and C#  
- **Targets the .NET runtime** ‚Äî compiles directly to IL and integrates with the .NET ecosystem  
- **Immutable, service-oriented design** ‚Äî a compiler built as an API, following the "Compiler-as-a-Service" philosophy  

Raven is primarily a **learning and exploration project**, aimed at:
- Understanding modern compiler construction
- Experimenting with language design
- Providing a clean API for syntax manipulation and analysis


## üî∞ Language Overview

Raven is a general-purpose, expression-oriented language with an expression-first design that blends functional and imperative paradigms. Its type system supports union and literal types with flow-sensitive typing similar to TypeScript, and it uses `unit` instead of `void`. As a .NET language, Raven interops seamlessly with C#, even shipping a C# analyzer for type unions. The compiler follows the Roslyn "compiler-as-a-service" architecture.

### Example

```raven
import System.*
import System.Console.*
import System.Collections.Generic.List<>
alias SB = System.Text.StringBuilder

let list = List<int>()
list.Add(1)
list.Add(42)
list.Add(3)
var i = 0

let stringBuilder = SB()

while i < list.Count {
    let x = list[i]
    stringBuilder.AppendLine(x.ToString())
    if x > 3 {
        WriteLine("Hello, World!")
        list[i] = 42
    }
    i = {
        let next = i + 1
        next
    }
}

WriteLine(stringBuilder.ToString())
```

**Highlights**:

* Control flow as expressions (`if`, `while`)
* `let` vs `var` (immutable vs mutable)
* Implicit returns (no `return` keyword)
* Array/index access
* Direct interop with .NET libraries

## ü™∂ Why the Name "Raven"?

Ravens are remarkable birds, known for their intelligence and adaptability.  

In Old Norse mythology, ravens held significant importance as messengers of Odin. His two ravens, **Huginn** ("thought") and **Muninn** ("memory/mind"), symbolized intellect and reflection‚Äîqualities that align with the goals of this language.  

The name reflects both the **mythological roots** and the **clever traits** of these birds.  
Alternative names considered: Old Norse **"Hrafn"** or Danish **"Ravn."**

## üéØ Project Goals

- **Create a Programming Language** ‚Äî build a language from the ground up, covering design and implementation.  
- **Focus on Parsing & Semantics** ‚Äî implement parsing, binding, and analysis as the backbone of compilation.  
- **Serve as a Reference** ‚Äî provide a well-documented example for compiler enthusiasts.  
- **Pragmatic Scope** ‚Äî aim for a practical subset of Roslyn-like features, not full parity.

## ‚ú® Syntax

See the pseudo-specification [here](/docs/lang/spec/language-specification.md).

More [samples](src/Raven.Compiler/samples/).

## üß© API

* Compiler API reference: [docs/compiler/api](docs/compiler/api)
* Example usage: [Raven.Compiler project](src/Raven.Compiler/Program.cs)

---

## üõ† Prerequisites

* [.NET SDK 9.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
* Optional: [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) for docs

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Restore packages
dotnet restore

# Generate syntax nodes (run from the Syntax directory)
cd src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Syntax
dotnet run --project ../../../tools/NodeGenerator   # add `-- -f` to force regeneration
cd ../../..

# Build and test
dotnet build Raven.sln
dotnet test
```

### Run the compiler

Command:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Raven.Compiler -- <path-to-file> -o <output-file-path>
```

Options:

- `--framework <tfm>` &ndash; target framework
- `--refs <path>` &ndash; additional metadata reference (repeatable)
- `-o <path>` &ndash; output assembly path
- `-s` &ndash; display the syntax tree (single file only)
- `-d` &ndash; dump syntax with highlighting (single file only)
- `-r` &ndash; print the raw source (single file only)
- `-b` &ndash; print the binder tree (single file only)
- `-bt` &ndash; print the bound tree (single file only)
- `--symbols [list|hierarchy]` &ndash; inspect source symbols (`list` dumps properties, `hierarchy` prints the tree)
- `-h`, `--help` &ndash; show help

Creating a `.debug/` directory in the current or parent folder causes the
compiler to emit per-file dumps (syntax tree, highlighted syntax, raw source,
bound tree, and binder tree) into that directory. The debug options above will additionally
write to the console when compiling a single file.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **When the arguments are omitted**, there is a hardcoded input file, and a hardcoded output file path (`test.dll`).

### Run the editor

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Raven.Editor -- <path-to-file>
```

When a file path is supplied, the editor opens the file and displays its name in the window title.

## üîß Development Notes

* The `RunNodeGenerator` target in `Raven.CodeAnalysis.csproj` runs automatically, but if generated files are missing, run the command manually.
* Generated files reside in `Syntax/generated/` and `Syntax/InternalSyntax/generated/` ‚Äî **do not edit by hand**.
* Always run `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` before committing.
