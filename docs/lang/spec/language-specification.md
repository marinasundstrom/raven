# Language specification

Implementation details describing how Raven projects map to .NET are documented in [dotnet-implementation.md](dotnet-implementation.md).

An overview of available types, literal semantics, and conversions can be found in the [type system](type-system.md).

## Document conventions

* **Normative requirements** use key words such as ‚Äúmust‚Äù, ‚Äúmay‚Äù, and ‚Äúshould‚Äù to describe observable language behaviour.
* Notes and tips highlight rationale, examples, or implementation remarks. They are informative rather than normative.
* Code snippets use the `.rav` file extension and omit surrounding boilerplate unless it is essential to the rule being described.
* When behaviour is intentionally unspecified or still under design, this specification calls it out explicitly and, where possible, links to suggested follow-up work.

## Code samples

You find them [here](../../../src/Raven.Compiler/samples/).

## Proposals

You find proposals for future language features [here](../proposals/).

## File extension

The file extension for source code files is: `.rav`.

> Perhaps in the future we should use `.rvn`.

## Grammar

An accompanying [EBNF grammar](grammar.ebnf) describes the structural
syntax of Raven. **It is non-normative**: it does not encode contextual rules,
disambiguation, or the full parsing process; those details are specified
throughout this language specification.

### Identifiers

Identifiers name values, members, and types. They may begin with `_`, `$`, or
any Unicode character classified as a letter (including letter numbers such as
Roman numerals). ASCII letters therefore continue to work as before. Subsequent
characters may also include decimal digits, connector punctuation (such as
`_`), combining marks, and format characters. These rules mirror .NET identifier
support so Raven source can interoperate with existing APIs. Reserved keywords
cannot be used as identifiers.

### Keyword summary

The lexer defines the complete keyword set in [`Tokens.xml`](../../../src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Syntax/Tokens.xml), which
classifies each keyword as either reserved or contextual.

| Kind | Keywords |
| --- | --- |
| Reserved | `and`, `as`, `base`, `bool`, `catch`, `char`, `class`, `double`, `each`, `else`, `enum`, `false`, `finally`, `for`, `func`, `if`, `int`, `interface`, `is`, `let`, `match`, `new`, `not`, `null`, `object`, `or`, `return`, `self`, `string`, `struct`, `true`, `try`, `var`, `when`, `while` |
| Contextual | `abstract`, `alias`, `get`, `import`, `in`, `init`, `internal`, `namespace`, `open`, `partial`, `out`, `override`, `private`, `protected`, `public`, `ref`, `sealed`, `set`, `static`, `unit`, `using`, `virtual` |

Reserved keywords are always treated as keywords and therefore unavailable for use as identifiers‚Äîeven when a construct makes
their presence optional (for example, omitting `each` in a `for` expression). Contextual keywords behave like ordinary
identifiers except in the syntactic positions that demand their special meaning‚Äîfor example, accessibility modifiers
(`public`, `internal`, `protected`, `private`) or accessor modifiers (`get`, `set`). The `partial` keyword is only recognised
when declaring types and controls whether multiple declarations of the same class merge; see [Partial classes](#partial-classes).

To use a reserved keyword as an identifier, prefix it with `@`. The lexer produces an identifier token whose `Text` still
includes the `@` escape, while the token's `ValueText` omits it. All bound symbols expose the unescaped name, mirroring C#'s
behaviour and ensuring metadata and semantic lookups use the identifier's logical name instead of its escaped form.

```raven
class @int {}

static @match(@return: int) -> int
{
    let @and = @return;
    return @and;
}
```

The single-character `_` token is reserved for discards. When a pattern,
deconstruction, or other declaration spells its designation as `_` (optionally
with a type annotation), the compiler suppresses the binding and treats the
designation as a discard instead. Longer identifiers may still contain
underscores, and `$` is available for interop- or DSL-oriented naming schemes.

```raven
let $ffiResult = call()
let value_1 = value0
let Êï∞ÊçÆ = call()
let —Å—É–º–º–∞ = total1 + total2
```

### Comments

Comments provide source-level annotations that the compiler ignores during
semantic analysis. They may appear anywhere whitespace is permitted, including
between tokens and at the end of a line. Comments never contribute tokens to
the syntax tree; they are attached as trivia instead.

Two forms of comments are supported:

* **Single-line comments** start with `//` and continue until the next newline
  or the end of the file. The terminating newline is not part of the comment.
* **Multi-line comments** start with `/*` and end with the next `*/`. They may
  span multiple lines but **do not nest**‚Äîa `/*` encountered inside a
  multi-line comment is treated as ordinary text. If the end of the file is
  reached before `*/`, the comment consumes the remainder of the file.

Comment contents are treated as uninterpreted Unicode text. Any Unicode scalar
value may appear inside a comment without escaping, including characters that
would otherwise form tokens. This includes emoji and other symbols outside the
Basic Multilingual Plane as long as the source file's encoding can represent
them. The lexer preserves the original spelling (other than omitting the
terminator), so encodings such as UTF-8 or UTF-16 must supply valid code units
for the desired characters.

```raven
let answer = 42  // the ultimate answer
let greeting = "hello"  // üòÄ emoji and other symbols are fine

/*
 Multi-line comments can document larger blocks of code.
 The first */ encountered closes the comment.
*/
```

## Syntax node model

The syntax node model defines the **logical structure** of Raven programs.
It is specified in [Model.xml](../../../src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Syntax/Model.xml) and
drives code generation of the immutable syntax tree API.

The model describes the set of node kinds and their children.
The **parser** applies the grammar and contextual rules to construct these nodes.

In short: the model defines the shape; the parser defines the rules,
as outlined in this specification.

## Unit type

Raven has no `void` type. The absence of a meaningful value is represented by the
`unit` type, which has exactly one value written `()`. The type itself may be
spelled `unit` or `()`. Functions without an explicit return type implicitly
return `unit`. In .NET, `unit` corresponds to `void` (see [implementation notes](dotnet-implementation.md#unit-type)). The `unit` type participates in generics, tuples, and unions like any other type.

## Statements

Raven is primarily **expression-oriented**: most constructs yield values and can
appear wherever an expression is expected, reflecting its expression-first design.
While Raven aims to be expression-oriented and declarative, it can still be used
in an imperative and procedural manner when desired.
For clarity and early exits, the language nevertheless permits certain imperative
statement forms, such as the explicit `return` statement.

Statements are terminated by a **newline**, or by an **optional semicolon** `;`
that may separate multiple statements on one line. Newlines inside
parentheses, brackets, or braces do not terminate statements. Multiple
consecutive newlines act as a single separator so you may visually group
related statements without affecting execution. Blocks also terminate with `}`,
and certain keywords (such as `else`, `catch`, and `finally`) implicitly end
the preceding construct. These tokens, along with end-of-file, fulfil the same
terminating role as a newline when they appear.

When a newline is not required to terminate a statement‚Äîor any other construct
that relies on newline separation, such as `import` or `alias` directives‚Äîit is
preserved as trivia on the following token. This occurs whenever the parser is
still expecting more of the current expression and therefore treats the newline
as part of a continuation rather than as a terminator.

### Line continuations

When the parser expects more tokens to complete the current expression, a
newline is treated as trivia on the following token instead of a statement
terminator. This permits expression-oriented code to flow naturally across
lines without requiring a trailing operator or explicit continuation marker.

Because the newline is preserved as trivia in these scenarios, any indentation
on the continued line also remains as trivia on the subsequent token. The
terminator token itself‚Äîwhether a newline, semicolon, or closing brace‚Äîremains
free of incidental trivia so its presence or absence is unambiguous.

The most common continuations occur after an assignment operator or when a
binary operator still requires its right-hand operand. Indentation on the
continued line becomes leading whitespace trivia for the next token, while the
terminating newline token itself remains trivia-free.

```raven
let sum =
    1
    + offset

let labelled = 42 // comment stays with the literal
let next =
    labelled
```

In the example above, the newline following `=` and the newline immediately
before `+` attach to the numeric literal and the operator, respectively. The
comment preceding a terminating newline remains trailing trivia on the
preceding token, and the indentation before `let next` is preserved as leading
whitespace on the next statement's first token.

```raven
let a = 42
let b = 1; b = 3
```

### Variable bindings

`let` introduces an immutable binding while `var` introduces a mutable one. A binding
may declare its type explicitly or rely on the compiler to infer it from the
initializer expression.

```raven
let answer = 42        // inferred int
var name = "Alice"   // inferred string, mutable
let count: long = 0    // explicit type
```

If the type annotation is omitted, an initializer is required so the compiler can
determine the variable's type. With an explicit type, the initializer may be
omitted.

Control-flow constructs such as `if`, `while`, and `for` are expressions.
When used for their side effects in statement position, they appear as expression statements and the produced value (always `()`)
is discarded.

### File-scope code

File-scope code is supported‚Äîno `Main` function is required.

```raven
import System.*
alias print = System.Console.WriteLine

sayHello()

func sayHello() {
    print("Hello, World!")
}
```

### Expression statements

Any expression can appear as a statement.

Control flow constructs such as `if`, `while`, and `for` also have dedicated statement forms for convenience. The parser
rewrites an expression in statement position to the corresponding statement node
when the value is discarded. `ExpressionStatement` covers the remaining
expressions that may appear on their own line and always evaluates to `unit`.

### Return statements

The `return` keyword exits a function, lambda, or property accessor. Because control-flow constructs are expressions, using `return` inside an expression that itself produces a value is not allowed. Explicit `return` statements may appear only in statement positions, such as within a function body or as their own expression statement. When a `return` occurs in a value context‚Äîfor example, within an `if` expression assigned to a variable‚Äîthe compiler reports diagnostic `RAV1900` and the block should rely on an implicit return instead. Within an `if` statement, the `else` keyword implicitly terminates a preceding `return`, allowing `if flag return else return` to be written without additional separators.

A `return` statement may omit its expression when the surrounding function or accessor returns `unit`. See [implementation notes](dotnet-implementation.md#return-statements) for how such returns are emitted. This is equivalent to returning the `()` value explicitly.

Within a method-like body, each `return` is validated against the declared
return type of that body. A `return` without an expression is treated as
returning `unit`. If the returned expression's type is not assignable to the
declared return type, the compiler emits a conversion diagnostic.

```raven
func DoOperation(a: int, b: int) -> int {
    if a > b {
        return -1
    }
    return a + b
}

func DoOperation2(a: int, b: int) -> int | false {
    if a > b {
        return false
    }
    return a + b
}
```

Property accessors follow the same rule: each explicit `return` must produce a value compatible with the property's declared type.

```raven
func choose(flag: bool) -> int | () {
    if flag {
        42            // implicit return
    } else {
        ()             // implicit return
    }
}

if flag {
    return 42          // allowed: expression used as a statement
}

func log(msg: string) {
    Console.WriteLine(msg)
    return            // equivalent to returning ()
}
```

### `break` statements

`break` exits the innermost enclosing loop statement immediately. Execution resumes at the statement following that loop.

```raven
var i = 0
while true {
    if i == 10 {
        break
    }

    i += 1
}
```

A `break` statement must appear within a `while` or `for` *statement*. Placing `break` in any expression context, including the bodies of `if`, `while`, or `for` expressions, produces diagnostic `RAV1902`. Using `break` outside a loop reports diagnostic `RAV2600`.

### `continue` statements

`continue` skips the remainder of the current loop iteration and jumps to the loop's re-check point.

```raven
for each value in values {
    if value.isOdd {
        continue
    }

    print(value)
}
```

`continue` follows the same placement rules as `break`: it may only appear inside `while` or `for` statements. Using it from an expression context results in diagnostic `RAV1903`, and placing it outside a loop reports diagnostic `RAV2601`.

### Labeled statements

A **labeled statement** prefixes another statement with an identifier followed by a colon:

```raven
start:
print("running")
```

Labels introduce symbolic targets that `goto` statements can reference. A label applies to the next statement in the source. When a newline immediately follows the colon, the compiler synthesizes an empty statement so the label remains a valid target even without an explicit body. Multiple labels may precede the same statement.

Label names are scoped to the containing function body. Declaring the same label more than once in the same body is an error (`RAV2500`). Labels participate in semantic lookup just like other declarations, so tools can navigate to them.

Like all statements, a label may only appear where the grammar permits statements. Attempting to nest a labeled statement inside an expression body (for example, inside the branches of an `if` expression) reports diagnostic `RAV1905`.

### `goto` statements

The `goto` statement jumps to a labeled statement within the same function-like body:

```raven
start:
print("loop")
goto start
```

Evaluation of a `goto` statement ends the current statement immediately and transfers control to the target label. Targets may appear before or after the `goto`; backward jumps form loops while forward jumps skip ahead in the block. Jumping to a nonexistent label produces diagnostic `RAV2501`.

Gotos cannot escape the body they are declared in. A `goto` inside a function, lambda, or accessor may only refer to labels declared in that same body. The compiler ensures any scopes exited by the jump are correctly unwound before branching.

`goto` statements follow the same placement rules as other control-flow statements: they are only legal in statement contexts. Embedding a `goto` inside an expression context (such as the body of an `if` expression) produces diagnostic `RAV1904`.

### Try statements

`try` statements provide structured exception handling. A `try` statement wraps a block and must include at least one `catch` clause or a `finally` clause. Omitting both results in diagnostic `RAV1015`.

```
try {
    operation()
} catch (FormatException ex) {
    Console.WriteLine($"Bad input: {ex.Message}")
} finally {
    cleanup()
}
```

Each `catch` may declare an exception type and optional identifier using `catch (Type name)`. The declared type must be or derive from `System.Exception`; otherwise the compiler reports `RAV1016`. When the identifier is omitted, the exception value is still available for pattern-based filtering but is not bound to a local. A bare `catch` with no parentheses is equivalent to `catch (System.Exception)` and handles all exceptions of that type.

The optional `finally` clause executes regardless of whether the `try` block or any `catch` clause complete normally.

## Expressions

### Target typing

Many expressions rely on the type expected by their context, called the **target type**.
For example, the enum shorthand `.B` in `var grade: Grades = .B` uses the declared type
`Grades` to resolve the member. Numeric literals and `null` similarly adapt to their
target types. Type inference for `let` and `var` bindings uses this mechanism to
determine the variable's type from its initializer.

### Type inference

When an expression or declaration omits an explicit type, Raven infers one from
the expression. If multiple different types can flow to a location‚Äîthrough
conditional branches or early `return` statements‚Äîthe inferred result becomes a
**union** of those types. The compiler does not collapse distinct types to their
nearest common base; returning `Dog` and `Cat` infers `Dog | Cat`, not `Animal`.

```raven
let pet = if flag { Dog() } else { Cat() }
// pet has type: Dog | Cat
```

Literal expressions infer the underlying primitive type when used to initialize
`let` or `var` bindings. Literal types are subset types of their underlying
primitive, so a literal like `1` can be used wherever an `int` is expected.
When inference gathers multiple results‚Äîsuch as the branches of an `if`
expression‚Äîit normalizes the union before exposing it. Literal members collapse
to their underlying type when a non-literal of the same type also flows to the
branch, so the union reflects only the distinct possibilities that can escape.
To retain a literal's singleton type for a single value, an explicit annotation
is required.

```raven
var i = 0       // i : int
let j = 0       // j : int
var k: 1 = 1    // k : 1
```

Control-flow expressions participate in the same inference. An `if` expression
whose branches produce different types infers a union of those results. The
union is normalized so redundant members collapse away while distinct literal
branches remain precise:

#### Collapsing branch unions

```raven
let x: int = 3
let value = if x > 2 { 42 } else { x }
// value : int          (literal 42 collapses into the `int` branch)

let digits = if x > 2 { 1 } else { 2 }
// digits : 1 | 2       (distinct literal branches remain literal)

let other: long = 0
let ambiguous = if x > 2 { other } else { 42 }
// ambiguous : int | long
// let target: int = ambiguous  // error: not every branch converts to int
```

Each branch contributes its inferred type to the union. Because the `else`
branch in the first example is the literal `42`, and the other branch produces
an `int`, the literal collapses into the `int` branch. When all branches are
distinct literals, the union records them individually so downstream pattern
matching can reason about the precise set of constants. When inference observes
multiple primitive types, the union retains each one. Assigning that union to a
single numeric type triggers a diagnostic because not every branch converts to
the target.

Numeric literals choose an underlying primitive type. Integer literals default
to `int` but upgrade to `long` when the value exceeds the `int` range.
Floating-point literals default to `double`; appending `f` or `F` produces a
`float` literal.

```raven
var l = 4_000_000_000  // l : long
var f = 3.14f          // f : float
var d = 3.14           // d : double
```

Overload resolution applies the same rule: a literal argument converts to its
underlying type when selecting among method overloads. For example,
`Console.WriteLine(1)` binds to `Console.WriteLine(int)` if such an overload
exists, and `Console.WriteLine("test")` chooses `Console.WriteLine(string)`.

Functions and lambdas without an annotated return type infer their result by
collecting the types of all explicit `return` statements and the final expression
of the body. If no value-returning path exists, the type defaults to `unit`.

```raven
func example(x: int) -> {
    if x > 0 { return x }
    "neg"
}
// inferred return type: int | string
```

### Additional type inference rules (normative)

The following clarifications extend the type inference model:

* **Contextual inference**: Raven computes a contextual type based on both expression shape and target type. Inference is bidirectional.
* **Union growth**: To prevent type explosion, implementations may limit union width. Public APIs that infer wide unions should prefer explicit annotations.
* **Literal arithmetic**: Non-constant operations widen literals to their base type unless constant-folded.
* **Overload resolution with unions**: A candidate overload is viable only if every alternative in a union converts to its parameter type. Ambiguities require explicit casts.
* **Generic inference**: Type argument inference from union arguments requires a single consistent set of type arguments that satisfy all alternatives. Constraints must hold for each alternative.
* **Nullability**: `T | null` with a single `T` is equivalent to `T?`. `T? | U` is invalid. Safe navigation over unions yields nullable results.
* **Pattern narrowing**: See [Pattern matching](#pattern-matching) for how `is` and `match` refine variables; inferred result types for `match` are the union of arm results.
* **Tuples**: Tuple element names do not affect type identity. Conditional tuples union element-wise.
* **Ref/out parameters**: `ref` requires exact type match; `out` contributes to inference of the parameter type.
* **Flow stability**: Variable declarations have a fixed declared type. Narrowings are ephemeral and do not change declared type. Captured variables use the join of all flows.
* **Diagnostics**: When conversion fails, diagnostics must identify which union member(s) failed and why. For overloads, diagnostics must explain alternative selections.

### Union conversions

Assigning or returning a union to an explicitly typed target succeeds only when
**every** member of the source union can convert to the target type. The compiler
checks each constituent individually.

```raven
let maybe = if flag { 0 } else { 1.0 } // int | float

let n: int = maybe    // error: float not assignable to int
let o: object = maybe // ok: both int and float convert to object

let pet = if flag { Dog() } else { Cat() } // Dog | Cat
let a: Animal = pet   // ok: Dog and Cat derive from Animal
let s: string = pet   // error: neither member converts to string
```

### Cast expressions

Explicit casts request a conversion to a specific type and use C# syntax.

```raven
let d = (double)1
let i = (int)3.14  // numeric narrowing
let s = obj as string
```

`(T)expr` performs a runtime check and throws an `InvalidCastException` when the value cannot convert to `T`. Use this form for downcasts, numeric narrowing, or unboxing scenarios.
`expr as T` attempts the conversion and returns `null` (or a nullable value type) instead of throwing on failure.

### `typeof` expressions

The `typeof` operator produces the runtime [`System.Type`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.type)
for a compile-time type. The operand must be a type syntax‚Äîpredefined, user-defined,
tuple, nullable, or union‚Äîand is not evaluated. The expression always has type
`System.Type`. Using a namespace or otherwise invalid type yields a binding
diagnostic.

```raven
let textType = typeof(string)
let listType = typeof(System.Collections.Generic.List<int>)
```

`typeof` is useful when reflecting over metadata or when passing type objects to
APIs such as `Activator.CreateInstance`.

### String literals

```raven
let hello = "Hello, "
Console.WriteLine(hello + "World!")
Console.WriteLine("Hello, " + 2)
```

String literals recognize the standard escape sequences shown below as well as
Unicode escapes. Use `\uXXXX` or `\UXXXXXXXX` for fixed-width hexadecimal
escapes, or `\u{...}` for variable-length scalars up to `0x10_FFFF`. Each escape
expands to the corresponding UTF-16 sequence, so `"\u{1F600}"` produces the üòÄ
emoji.

| Escape | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `\\0` | Null character |
| `\\a` | Alert (BEL) |
| `\\b` | Backspace |
| `\\t` | Horizontal tab |
| `\\n` | Line feed |
| `\\v` | Vertical tab |
| `\\f` | Form feed |
| `\\r` | Carriage return |
| `\\"` | Double quote |
| `\\'` | Single quote |
| `\\\\` | Backslash |
| `\\$` | Literal dollar sign in interpolated strings |

### String interpolation

Embed expressions directly into strings using `${...}` without requiring a prefix.

```raven
let name = "Alice"
let age = 30
let msg = "Name: ${name}, Age: ${age}"
Console.WriteLine(msg)
```

Escapes inside the literal portions of an interpolated string follow the same
rules as ordinary string literals, ensuring Unicode escapes work uniformly in
both forms.

Interpolated strings preserve Unicode content from both left-to-right and
right-to-left scripts. Literal segments keep their original characters so that
text such as Japanese kana or Arabic phrases stay intact around the embedded
expressions.

```raven
let name = "ŸÑŸäŸÑŸâ"
let city = "ÿØÿ®Ÿä"
let welcome = "\u200FŸÖÿ±ÿ≠ÿ®ÿß ${name}! ÿ£ŸáŸÑÿß ÿ®ŸÉ ŸÅŸä ${city}"
```

The `\u200F` right-to-left mark keeps the greeting flowing correctly even when
mixing scripts in the same interpolated string.

### Collection expressions

Collection expressions use bracket syntax `[element0, element1, ...]` (with an optional
trailing comma) to build arrays and other collection types. Elements are evaluated
from left to right. In addition to ordinary expressions, an element may be written as
`..expression`‚Äîcalled a *spread*. Spreads enumerate the runtime value and insert each
item into the resulting collection in order. The spread source must be convertible to
`System.Collections.IEnumerable` (including arrays and `IEnumerable<T>` implementations);
otherwise diagnostic `RAV2022` is reported. „ÄêF:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Binder/BlockBinder.cs‚Ä†L3620-L3670„Äë„ÄêF:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/DiagnosticDescriptors.xml‚Ä†L260-L266„Äë

Collection expressions are target-typed:

* **Array targets** ‚Äî When the expected type is an array `T[]`, the expression allocates a
  new array of that element type. Each item is implicitly converted to `T` before storage,
  and spreads must enumerate values assignable to `T`. „ÄêF:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Binder/BlockBinder.cs‚Ä†L3672-L3738„Äë„ÄêF:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/CodeGen/Generators/ExpressionGenerator.cs‚Ä†L950-L1016„Äë
* **Collection targets** ‚Äî When the expected type is a non-array type with an accessible
  parameterless constructor and an instance `Add` method, the compiler constructs the
  target and calls `Add` for every element. The `Add` parameter determines the element
  conversions, and spread entries must supply compatible values. „ÄêF:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Binder/BlockBinder.cs‚Ä†L3738-L3776„Äë„ÄêF:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/CodeGen/Generators/ExpressionGenerator.cs‚Ä†L1016-L1096„Äë
* **No target type** ‚Äî Without an expected type, Raven infers a best common element type
  by merging the contributions of each element (spreads use their enumerated element type).
  The expression then produces an array of that inferred element type, defaulting to
  `object` when no more precise choice is available. „ÄêF:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Binder/BlockBinder.cs‚Ä†L3776-L3861„Äë

An empty collection expression `[]` must be used in a context that supplies a target type;
otherwise its type cannot be inferred. When a target type is available, the compiler
produces an empty instance of that type (an empty array or an initialized collection).
„ÄêF:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Binder/BlockBinder.cs‚Ä†L3620-L3651„Äë„ÄêF:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/CodeGen/Generators/ExpressionGenerator.cs‚Ä†L1170-L1192„Äë

```raven
let numbers: int[] = [1, 2, 3]
let combined = [0, ..numbers, 4]

let names: List<string> = ["a", "b"]
let inferred = [1, 2.0]  // inferred as object[]
```

#### Element access

```raven
let list = [1, 42, 3]
let a = list[1]
```

### Function invocation

```raven
Foo(1, 2)
Console.WriteLine("Test")
```

The `()` call operator invokes a function-valued expression. If the target
expression's type defines an invocation operator via a `self` method, that
member is invoked instead; see [Invocation operator](#invocation-operator).

When the target has optional parameters, omitted trailing arguments are filled
in using the defaults declared on the parameter list. The supplied arguments are
matched positionally before defaults are considered.

#### Extension method invocation

Raven participates in the .NET extension method model for consumption. When a
method-style member access does not resolve to an instance member, the compiler
searches imported namespaces and type scopes for extension methods whose first
parameter (the `this` receiver in C#) accepts the receiver expression. Eligible
candidates are merged into overload resolution alongside instance methods, with
instance members winning any ties. Once selected, the receiver expression is
passed as the leading argument to the static method.

Extension methods become available by importing their declaring type or
namespace using `import`. For example, `import System.Linq.*` exposes the LINQ
operators from `System.Linq.Enumerable`, and `import System.MemoryExtensions`
brings the span helpers from `System.MemoryExtensions`. Accessibility checks and
diagnostics mirror those for ordinary methods; the compiler reports an error
when no applicable extension can be found.

### Object creation

Objects are created by **calling the type name** directly, just like any
other method.

```raven
let sb = StringBuilder()
sb.AppendLine("Foo")
````

Generic types work the same way:

```raven
let list = List<int>()
list.Add(2)
```

Raven also supports the `new` keyword for **backwards compatibility** and
for cases where you want to be explicit about creating an object:

```raven
let sb = new StringBuilder()
let list = new List<int>()
```

This way it‚Äôs clear that *constructor-as-call* is the default, and `new` is optional/explicit.  

### Tuple expressions and access

Tuples can be **named** or **positional**. Both projections are available.

```raven
let tuple = (a: 42, b: 2)
Console.WriteLine(tuple.a)      // named
Console.WriteLine(tuple.Item1)  // positional
```

### Block expression

A block is an expression; its value is the value of its last expression
(or `()` if none). Each block introduces a new scope for local declarations.

```raven
{
    let x = 10
    x + 1
}
```

### `if` expression

`if` expressions evaluate the condition and execute exactly one branch. The
value of the overall expression is the value produced by the executed branch. If
both branches produce values, the result participates in type inference as
described in [Type inference](#type-inference).

```raven
let res =
    if cond {
        10
    } else {
        20
    }
```

When an `if` expression is used purely for its effects, omitting the `else`
branch is permitted and the value is ignored. In value contexts, provide an
`else` branch so that both outcomes yield a value. (See [Outstanding
questions](#outstanding-questions-and-suggested-follow-ups) for current gaps and
suggested fixes.)

### `while` expression

`while` repeatedly executes its body while the condition evaluates to `true`.
Because loops are expressions, the overall value of a `while` expression is `()`.

```raven
var i = 0
while i < list.Length {
    let item = list[i]
    Console.WriteLine(item)
    i = i + 1
}
```

### `for` expression

Iterates over each element of a collection, binding it to a fresh local. The optional
`each` keyword improves readability.

```raven
for each item in items {
    Console.WriteLine(item)
}
```

The `each` keyword may be omitted:

```raven
for item in items {
    doSomething(item)
}
```

`for` evaluates the collection once, then executes the body for every element.
When iterating over arrays, the element type comes from the array's element
type. Other collections are currently treated as `System.Collections.IEnumerable`
and default the iteration variable to `object`. Like other looping constructs, a
`for` expression evaluates to `()`.

### Pattern matching

Patterns let you inspect values using concise, algebraic syntax. They appear in
`is` predicates and in `match` expressions and participate in Raven's
flow-sensitive type analysis.

#### Pattern forms

Patterns compose from the following primitives:

- `Type` ‚Äî type pattern; succeeds when the scrutinee can convert to `Type`.
  No binding is introduced.
- `Type name` ‚Äî typed binding; succeeds when the scrutinee converts to
  `Type`, then binds the converted value to `name` as an immutable local.
- `_` / `Type _` ‚Äî discard; matches anything without introducing a binding.
  The typed form asserts the value can convert to `Type` while still discarding
  it. Because `_` is reserved for discards, writing `_` as the designation never
  creates a binding. Discards participate in pattern exhaustiveness: an
  unguarded `_` arm is considered a catch-all and satisfies any remaining cases
  even when earlier arms introduced bindings.
- `literal` ‚Äî literal pattern; matches when the scrutinee equals the literal.
  Literal patterns piggyback on Raven's literal types, so `"on"` or `42`
  narrow unions precisely.
- `pattern1 or pattern2` ‚Äî alternative; matches when either operand matches.
  Parentheses may be used to group alternatives.
- `not pattern` ‚Äî complement; succeeds when the operand fails. `not` does not
  introduce bindings even if its operand would.

`or` associates to the left, `not` binds tighter than `or`, and parentheses
override the default precedence as needed.

```raven
if payload is string {
    Console.WriteLine("plain text payload")
}

if payload is string body {
    Console.WriteLine("bytes ${body.Length}")
}

if payload is string _ {
    Console.WriteLine("stringly typed legacy input")
}

if value is "ok" or "pending" {
    Console.WriteLine("proceed")
}

if mode is not ("on" or "off") {
    Console.WriteLine("unexpected mode")
}
```

#### `is` expression

`expr is pattern` evaluates to `bool`. On success, the compiler narrows the
expression to the pattern's accept set inside the `true` branch and discards the
matched portion from the `false` branch. Any bindings introduced by the pattern
are immutable locals scoped to the `true` branch.

```raven
let token: object = read()

if token is int n {
    Console.WriteLine(n + 1) // token is narrowed to int here
} else if token is "quit" {
    Console.WriteLine("bye")
}
```

#### `match` expression

`match` uses braces with newline-separated arms:

```raven
match scrutinee {
    pattern [when guard] => result
    pattern => result
}
```

Arms are evaluated top to bottom. The first matching arm produces the
expression's value. Guards run after the pattern succeeds; they do not
influence exhaustiveness checking.

The scrutinee expression is evaluated exactly once before any arm runs.
Each arm introduces its own scope: pattern bindings are in scope for the
optional `when` guard and the arm's result expression, but they do not leak
into later arms. Guards use the `when` keyword and execute only after the
pattern succeeds; if the guard evaluates to `false`, evaluation falls through
to the next arm.

```raven
let state: "on" | "off" | "auto"

let description =
    match state {
        "on" or "auto" => "enabled"
        "off"         => "disabled"
    }
```

When multiple arms yield different types, the result type is the normalized
union of the arm results.

```raven
func classify(value: object) -> string {
    match value {
        string text when text.Length > 0 => text
        0                                 => "zero"
        _                                 => "unknown ${value}"
    }
}
```

Local helpers use the same `func` syntax‚Äîthere is no separate F#-style `let` function form.

`match` requires exhaustiveness. For finite literal unions, every literal must
appear (or `_` used). When the scrutinee type includes an open set (for example
`int`, `string`, or a class hierarchy), add a catch-all arm (`_` or a broader
type pattern) to cover the remainder. Because `_` is a discard, it never
introduces a binding and always matches, so placing it last is a common way to
describe fallback behavior. Missing coverage produces `RAV2100`; redundant arms
that can never be chosen produce unreachable diagnostics (`RAV2101`), and
catch-alls that are unnecessary because earlier arms already cover every case
produce `RAV2103`.

#### Flow-sensitive narrowing

Both `is` and `match` feed Raven's flow analysis. Within the successful branch
of `is`, or inside a matched arm, the scrutinee is narrowed to the pattern's
accept set and all pattern bindings are in scope. The complement carries through
the opposite branch. Guard expressions do not participate in this narrowing, but
they may use the bindings established by the pattern they accompany.

## Namespace declaration

Each file may define a namespace:

```raven
namespace Foo

// Members here
```

### Import directive

```raven
namespace Foo

import System.*
// or import System.Collections.*

// Members here
```

The wildcard may also be applied to a type name to bring its static members
and nested types into scope:

```raven
import System.Math.*

let pi = PI
```

Extension methods defined on imported types are also brought into scope. This
enables consuming .NET helpers such as `System.Linq.Enumerable.Where` or
`System.MemoryExtensions.AsSpan` directly from Raven source:

```raven
import System.Collections.Generic.*
import System.Linq.*

let odds = List<int>()
odds.Add(1)
odds.Add(3)
let filtered = odds.Where(func (value) => value % 2 == 1)
```

The compiler treats `Where` as an instance-style invocation even though it is
declared as a static C# extension method, inserting the receiver as the first
argument when emitting IL.

Import directives appear at the beginning of a compilation unit or namespace and
simply make existing namespaces or types available. They do not introduce new
names. To bind a custom name, use an `alias` directive. All imports for a given
scope must come before any alias directives or member declarations. Placing an
import directive after an alias or member is a compile-time error (`RAV1005`).

### Alias directive

The `alias` directive assigns an alternative name to a fully qualified
**namespace**, type, static member, or to any type expression such as tuples
and type unions.

```raven
alias IO = System.IO
alias SB = System.Text.StringBuilder
alias PrintLine = System.Console.WriteLine
alias Pair = (x: int, y: int)
alias Number = int | string
alias Flag = bool
alias Text = string
alias Five = 5

let sb = SB()
PrintLine("Hi")
let tmp = IO.Path.GetTempPath()
```

Aliasing a method binds a specific overload. Multiple directives using the
same alias name may appear to alias additional overloads, forming an overload
set.

Predefined and literal types may be aliased directly. The supported built-in alias targets are `bool`, `char`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `string`, and `unit` (spelled `unit` or `()`), and any literal value. Raven has no `void`; the `unit` type is used instead (see [implementation notes](dotnet-implementation.md#unit-type)). If the alias target is invalid, the compiler emits diagnostic `RAV2020`, which lists the supported targets such as types, namespaces, unions, tuples, these predefined types, and literal values.

Aliases require fully qualified names for namespaces, types, and members to
avoid ambiguity; type expressions are written directly. Alias directives may
appear at the top of a file or inside a namespace but must follow all import
directives and precede any declarations or statements. An alias directive that
appears after a member declaration produces diagnostic `RAV1006`.

### Scoped namespaces

You may define multiple namespaces (including nested) in one file using
block scopes:

```raven
// Members in the global namespace

namespace A1
{
    import System.*
    import System.IO.*

    // Members here

    namespace B1
    {
        // Members here
    }
}

namespace A.B
{
    // Members here
}
```

The outermost undeclared namespace is the **global namespace**.

### File-scope code rules

Files may start with executable statements that aren't enclosed in a function or
type. This file-scope code forms the application's entry point and is translated
into `Program.Main`. Only console applications may include file-scope code, and
it may appear in at most one file per compilation. When present, these
statements must come before any other declarations in the file or its
file-scoped namespace.

Function declarations (local function statements) within file-scope code are
hoisted and may be referenced from anywhere in that file-scoped region,
regardless of their order.

### Entry point resolution

Console applications begin executing at the synthesized `Program.Main` method
that backs file-scope code. When a project does not contain file-scope
statements, the compiler instead looks for a user-defined entry point. Any
static method named `Main` qualifies when it meets the following requirements:

* The method returns `unit`, `void`, or `int`.
* It has no type parameters.
* It declares either no parameters or a single parameter of type `string[]`
  (representing the command-line arguments).

If exactly one method satisfies these conditions, it becomes the entry point for
the compilation. When no method qualifies, the compiler reports
`RAV1014` *Program.Main entry point not found*. Declaring more than one valid
`Main` (including mixing top-level statements with a matching method) causes the
compiler to emit `RAV1017` *Program has more than one entry point defined*.

Library and script output kinds ignore the entry point search; they never report
missing or ambiguous entry-point diagnostics.

## Functions

```raven
func Foo(a: int, b: int) -> int
{
    a + b
}
```

Arrow bodies are allowed:

```raven
func add(a: int, b: int) -> int => a + b
```

### Parameters

Function, method, and accessor parameters use the `name: Type` syntax. Parameter
names are required and participate in overload resolution alongside their types
and any `ref`/`out` modifiers.

Parameters may provide a default value using `= expression` after the type. A
parameter with a default value is optional when invoking the function: callers
can omit that argument and the compiler supplies the stored constant instead.
Only trailing parameters may be optional; omitting an argument fixes the default
for that position and all following parameters must also declare defaults.

```raven
func greet(name: string, punctuation: string = "!")
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Hello, ${name}${punctuation}")
}

greet("Raven")          // prints "Hello, Raven!"
greet("Raven", "!!!")    // caller-provided punctuation wins
```

Default expressions must be compile-time constants: literals (including `null`),
parenthesized literals, and unary `+`/`-` applied to numeric literals. The value
must convert to the parameter type using an implicit conversion. Nullable value
types accept `null` defaults; other value types require a literal of the
underlying type. Reference-type parameters accept `null` defaults.

### Generic functions and methods

Functions‚Äîincluding methods declared inside types‚Äîmay introduce type parameters
by placing `<...>` after the function name. Each type parameter can be used in
the parameter list, return type, and body just like any other type annotation.

```raven
func identity<T>(value: T) -> T { value }

let number = identity(42)         // inferred T = int
let text = identity<string>("hi")
```

Call sites may omit explicit type arguments when inference can determine a
unique solution from the arguments and expected return type. When inference
fails‚Äîfor example, because multiple type choices satisfy the call‚Äîthe type
arguments must be provided explicitly.

Method declarations use the same syntax:

```raven
class Cache
{
    static store<T: class>(value: T) { /* ... */ }
}

Cache.store(System.Text.StringBuilder())   // inference picks T = System.Text.StringBuilder
Cache.store<string>(null)                  // explicit type argument when passing null
```

Type parameter constraints mirror those on generic types. After the colon, list
`class`, `struct`, or specific base/interface types that each argument must
implement. Violating a constraint produces a diagnostic identifying the failing
type argument and the unmet requirement.

### Nested functions

Functions may be declared inside other functions. Such a function is
scoped to its containing body and can capture local variables.

```raven
func outer() {
    func inner(x: int) -> int { x + 1 }
    let y = inner(2)
}
```

### Lambda expressions and captured variables

Lambda expressions use the `func` keyword followed by a parameter list, an
arrow, and either an expression or block body. Lambdas may appear wherever a
function value is expected. When a lambda references a local defined in an
outer scope, the compiler lifts that local into shared closure storage so both
the outer scope and the lambda observe the same value. Each captured local is
wrapped in a reference cell (implemented with `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.StrongBox<T>`)
when the local is declared. Reads and writes in any scope dereference that
shared cell, so mutating a `var` binding after creating a lambda immediately
affects all delegates that captured it. Capturing `self` produces a reference to
the enclosing instance, and capturing parameters preserves the argument value
from the invoking scope. Nested lambdas reuse the closure instances produced by
their enclosing scopes so that captures shared across multiple lambda layers
continue to reference the same storage locations.

Lambda parameter types are optional when the expression is converted to a known
delegate type. The compiler infers the parameter types (and any `ref`/`out`
modifiers) from the delegate's `Invoke` signature and converts the body to the
delegate's return type. If no delegate context is available, diagnostic
`RAV2200` is reported and explicit parameter annotations are required.

### Function values and method references

Functions and methods are first-class values. Referencing a function or method
name without invoking it produces a delegate that can be stored, passed around,
or invoked later. The compiler picks an appropriate delegate type using the
same target-typing rules that guide overload resolution. In a binding such as
`let` or `var`, the initializer (or an explicit type annotation) supplies that
context so the delegate type‚Äîand corresponding overload‚Äîcan be determined.
When no delegate context is available, diagnostic `RAV2201` is reported and the
method must either be invoked directly or annotated with a delegate type.

```raven
let writeLine: System.Action<string> = Console.WriteLine
writeLine("Hello from Raven!")
```

If the referenced member has no overloads, the compiler may omit the
annotation and still infer the delegate type from that unique signature.

When the referenced method defines multiple overloads, Raven does **not** allow
an unannotated binding to rely solely on type inference; such declarations are
ambiguous and produce diagnostic `RAV2202`. To disambiguate, provide the
delegate type explicitly or use another context with a well-defined target
type.

```raven
let writeLine = Console.WriteLine             // error: overloaded method group
let writeLine: System.Action<string> = Console.WriteLine // ok
```

Passing `Console.WriteLine` as an argument to a parameter of type
`System.Action<string>` likewise selects the `string` overload without requiring
an explicit annotation at the call site. If no overload matches the target
delegate's signature, diagnostic `RAV2203` is produced.

If no compatible delegate type exists in the current context, the compiler
generates one whose signature matches the referenced function or method. The
generated delegate observes the same parameter list (including `ref`/`out`
modifiers) and return type as the source symbol so the resulting value behaves
identically to directly invoking that member. Subsequent uses of the same
signature within the compilation reuse the synthesized delegate.

Instance method references capture their receiver automatically. Evaluating
`self.Member` as a value stores the current instance alongside the referenced
method so later invocations execute against the same object:

```raven
class Counter {
    value: int = 3

    Increment(delta: int) -> int { self.value + delta }

    Run() -> int {
        let increment = self.Increment
        increment(7) // returns 10
    }
}
```

Method references may be passed directly to parameters of delegate type. The
overload chosen for the receiving method is the one whose delegate parameter
matches the referenced method's signature:

```raven
func Run(action: System.Action<string>) { action("ready") }
func Run(value: string) { Console.WriteLine(value) }

Run(Console.WriteLine) // selects the Action<string> overload
```

When a referenced method's signature requires a delegate that doesn't already
exist‚Äîsuch as one with `ref`/`out` parameters‚ÄîRaven synthesizes an internal
delegate type and uses it as the expression's type. These delegates behave like
framework-provided types and faithfully propagate modifiers:

```raven
class Accumulator {
    static TryAccumulate(state: &int, out doubled: &int) -> bool {
        state = state + 1
        doubled = state * 2
        true
    }

    static Execute(value: int) -> int {
        let callback = Accumulator.TryAccumulate
        var current = value
        var doubled = 0

        callback(&current, &doubled)
        current + doubled // evaluates to 12 when value is 3
    }
}
```

### `ref`/`out` arguments

Parameters can be declared by reference using `&Type`. Use `out` before
the parameter name to indicate that the value must be assigned by the
callee. At call sites, pass the argument with the address operator `&`.
(Exact rules are contextual; the binder enforces that the target is
assignable.)

```raven
func TryParse(text: string, out result: &int) -> bool { /* ... */ }

var total = 0
if !TryParse(arg, &total) {
    Console.WriteLine("Expected number")
}
```

## Local declarations

### Value binding (`let`)

A `let` binding is **immutable** (not reassignable). Types are inferred
unless annotated.

```raven
let x = "Foo"
let y: int = 2
let a: int = 2, b: string = ""
```

### Variable binding (`var`)

A `var` binding is **mutable** (reassignable).

```raven
var x = "Foo"
x = "Bar"

var y: int = 2
y = 3
```

### Resource declarations (`using`)

Prefixing a local declaration with `using` introduces a scoped disposable resource. The
declaration follows the normal `let`/`var` syntax and must include an initializer. Both the
initializer's type and the declared type must be convertible to `System.IDisposable`; if
either conversion fails, Raven reports the same assignment diagnostic used for other
implicit conversions. „ÄêF:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Binder/BlockBinder.cs‚Ä†L188-L224„Äë

Resources created with `using` remain in scope like ordinary locals but are automatically
disposed when control leaves the enclosing block. Disposal runs in reverse declaration
order so that later resources observe earlier ones still alive. File-scope `using`
declarations participate as well: they are disposed after the file's top-level statements
finish executing. „ÄêF:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Binder/BlockBinder.cs‚Ä†L222-L282„Äë„ÄêF:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/CodeGen/Generators/Generator.cs‚Ä†L54-L87„Äë„ÄêF:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/CodeGen/MethodBodyGenerator.cs‚Ä†L114-L148„Äë

```raven
using let stream = System.IO.File.OpenRead(path)
using var reader = System.IO.StreamReader(stream)

let text = reader.ReadToEnd()
// reader.Dispose() and stream.Dispose() run automatically when the scope ends
```

## Types

### Type annotations

Use type annotations where inference is insufficient (e.g., for
parameters, some bindings, or return types):

```raven
let a = 2
let b: int = 2

func add(a: int, b: int) -> int { a + b }
```

### Tuple types

Tuple types use parentheses with comma-separated element types and map to
`System.ValueTuple`:

```raven
let pair: (int, string) = (42, "answer")
```

Elements may optionally be named with a `name: Type` pair. Names exist only for
developer clarity and do not participate in type identity or assignment:

```raven
let tuple2: (id: int, name: string) = (no: 42, identifier: "Bar")
```

When a tuple expression is assigned to an explicitly annotated tuple type, each
element is validated against the corresponding element type. Elements are
accessed positionally (e.g. `Item1`, `Item2`). Tuple types may nest or
participate in other type constructs such as unions or nullability.

### Union types

Unions express multiple possible types (e.g., `int | string`). A union‚Äôs members are **normalized**: nested unions flatten, duplicates are removed, and order is irrelevant. For example, `int | (string | int)` simplifies to `int | string`.

```raven
let a: int | string
let b = if flag { 1 } else { "one" }  // b : int | string
```

#### Literal types in unions

A **literal type** represents a single constant value of a primitive, string, bool, or enum type. Literal types may appear anywhere a type is expected and compose naturally with unions.

```raven
let n: 1 | 2 | 3
let s: "on" | "off" | "auto"
let e: Grades.A | Grades.B
```

**Normalization with literals**:

* A literal type `L(c : B)` is a subtype of its base `B`. If a union contains both `B` and any of its literals, the literal members **collapse into** `B` *unless* the union has only literals of that base (a finite domain).

  * `int | 42` ‚Üí `int`
  * `1 | 2` stays as `1 | 2`
* Literal types of **different bases** remain distinct: `3 | 2L` (assuming `long`) stays as `int | long`.

#### Nullability and `null`

`null` may appear as a union member:

```raven
let maybe = if flag { 1 } else { null }  // int | null
```

If a union contains `null` and exactly one non-nullable type `T`, it implicitly converts to `T?` (both in inference and explicit annotations):

```raven
let x: int? = maybe         // ok
let y: string? | int        // error: explicit nullable types must not be unioned
```

#### Assignability and conversions

Let `U = T1 | ‚Ä¶ | Tn` be a source union.

* **Value ‚Üí union**: An expression of type `S` may be assigned to `U` if `S` is assignable to **at least one** member `Ti`.
* **Union ‚Üí value**: `U` may be assigned to `S` only if **every** member `Ti` is assignable to `S`.
* **Literal checking**: Assigning to a **finite literal union** requires the value to be a compile-time constant equal to one of the listed literals.
* **Variant interfaces**: When `Ti` or `S` is a generic interface or delegate, assignability follows the CLR's variance annotations. Covariant parameters permit `T<Derived>` to flow to `T<Base>`, and contravariant parameters accept `T<Base>` where `T<Derived>` is expected. Raven interface declarations expose the same behaviour with `out` and `in` modifiers on their type parameters, so source and metadata symbols participate in the same set of conversions.

```raven
let a: "true" | 1 = 1      // ok
let b: "true" | 1 = 2      // error: 2 not permitted by '"true" | 1'
let c: "yes" | "no" = "yes"  // ok
```

When a union value is assigned or returned to an explicit target type, the compiler checks each constituent individually:

```raven
let u = if flag { 0 } else { 1.0 }  // int | float

let i: int = u       // error: float not assignable to int
let o: object = u    // ok: both convert to object
```

#### Type inference with control flow

Control-flow expressions that produce different types infer a union of those results. The union is normalized; literal branches collapse into their base if a non-literal of that base also flows.

```raven
let x = if flag { 42 } else { 3 }        // x : 42 | 3
let y = if flag { 42 } else { parseInt() } // y : int   (42 collapses into int)
```

#### Pattern matching and flow-sensitive narrowing

See [Pattern matching](#pattern-matching) for the full set of pattern forms and
for how `is` and `match` narrow union members. Literal unions stay precise so
long as every literal appears in a branch, and open-ended unions require a
catch-all arm or type pattern to remain exhaustive. Guards participate only in
the arm that defines them and do not relax the exhaustiveness checks on the
outer pattern.

#### Member access on unions (nominal CLR members only)

A member access `u.M(...)` on `u : T1 | ‚Ä¶ | Tn` is permitted **only** when all element types share the **same CLR member origin** via a common base class or interface (same original definition/slot). The intersection remains purely **nominal**: only members declared on the hierarchy can satisfy the rule. Extension methods may still be invoked when in scope, but they do not cause a member to be considered common to the union.

* **What counts as common**: a method/property/indexer/event declared on the nearest common base class or on an interface implemented by **all** `Ti`, where each `Ti` inherits/overrides/implements that same original member.
* **Overloads**: intersect overload sets by original definition; only the common overloads remain available.
* **Properties**: a setter is available only if all elements have a setter; a getter only if all have a getter.

Typing and lowering:

```raven
let msg = u.ToString()   // treat receiver as the ancestor that declares ToString
// lower: ((Ancestor)u).ToString()
```

If any element **hides** the base member with `new` (different original), or an overload isn‚Äôt present on some element, the access is rejected with a diagnostic suggesting a cast or pattern match.

Examples:

```raven
open class Animal { virtual Speak() -> string }
class Dog : Animal { override Speak() -> "woof" }
class Cat : Animal { override Speak() -> "meow" }

let a: Dog | Cat
let sound = a.Speak()    // ok via Animal.Speak
```

```raven
class Base { virtual P: int { get; set; } }
class D1 : Base { override P : int { get; set; } }
class D2 : Base { override P : int { get; } }

let u: D1 | D2
let x = u.P      // ok (getter common)
u.P = 3          // error (setter not common)
```

#### Operations on literal types

Operations generally **widen** literals to their base types unless constant-folding applies:

```raven
let k: 2 | 42 = 2
let z = k + 1       // z : int
```

Enum literals retain the enum type identity; matching respects the enum, not just underlying integral values.

#### Summary of rules (normative)

* Union normalization:

  * Flatten, deduplicate; literal collapse into base only in the presence of that base.
  * `null | T` with a single `T` converts to `T?`; explicit `T? | U` is invalid.
* Assignability:

  * `S ‚Üí (T1 | ‚Ä¶ | Tn)` if `S ‚Üí Ti` for some `i`.
  * `(T1 | ‚Ä¶ | Tn) ‚Üí S` if `Ti ‚Üí S` for **all** `i`.
  * Finite literal unions accept only matching constants.
* Flow narrowing:

  * `is`/`==` with literals narrows to the accept set in the then-branch and subtracts it in the else-branch; `match` arms behave analogously.
* Member access:

  * Allowed iff a single base/interface original member is common to **all** elements; overloads intersect by original definition; lower via an ancestor cast and virtual/interface call.
  * Extension methods are discovered separately. They may be invoked when in scope and applicable to the receiver, but they do not satisfy the nominal intersection requirement above.

For .NET representation and lowering strategies (switches, interface dispatch), see [implementation notes](dotnet-implementation.md#union-types).

### Nullable types

Appending `?` to a type denotes that it may also be `null`. This works for
both reference and value types.

```raven
let s: string? = null
let i: int? = null
```

Nullable types participate in the type system and overload resolution.

### Null-conditional access

The null-conditional operator `?.` safely accesses members or elements of a
nullable value. The expression `expr?.Member` evaluates `expr`; if the result is
`null`, the overall expression evaluates to `null` instead of throwing. When the
receiver is not `null`, the member access proceeds normally. This operator works
for both nullable reference types and nullable value types.

```raven
var str = x?.ToString()

let number: int? = 42
let digits = number?.ToString() // "42"
```

Here `str` is `string?`, and the call to `ToString` only occurs when `x` is not
`null`. When the receiver is a nullable value type, the compiler unwraps the
`System.Nullable<T>` storage, invokes the member on the underlying value, and
wraps the result back into a nullable type.

### Enums

An enum declaration introduces a distinct type whose instances are one of a
fixed set of named constants. Each member is implicitly static and has an
underlying integer value starting at `0` and increasing by one. Explicit numeric
values are not yet supported.

```raven
enum Grades { A, B, C }
```

Enum members can be referenced with the type name or, when the target type is
known, with a **leading dot**:

```raven
var grade: Grades = .B
grade = Grades.C
```

Importing the members of an enum brings them into scope:

```raven
import Grades.*
let best = A
```

## Members (classes/structs)

Raven supports classes and structs with fields, methods, constructors,
properties, and indexers. Modifiers are C#-like but validated by the
binder (e.g., `abstract` members require an `abstract` type; `override`
requires a virtual base member).

```raven
class Counter
{
    public let Name: string

    private var _value: int = 0

    init(name: string) { Name = name }

    public Value: int {
        get => _value
        private set => _value = value
    }

    // Indexer
    public this[i: int]: int {
        get => _value + i
    }

    public Increment() -> () => _value = _value + 1
}
```

**Notes**

* Fields use `let`/`var` and require `;` after declarators.
* Accessor-level access (e.g., `private set`) is supported.
* Methods/ctors/properties/indexers may use arrow bodies.
* Members can be marked `static` to associate them with the type rather than an instance.

### Generic types

Classes and structs optionally declare type parameters immediately after the
type name. The parameters become part of the type's identity and are available
throughout the member list.

```raven
class Box<T>
{
    public Value: T { get; }

    init(value: T) { Value = value }
}

let ints = Box<int>(1)
let words = Box<string>("ok")
```

Instantiating a generic type supplies concrete type arguments between `<` and
`>` in the same order the parameters were declared. The compiler emits standard
CLR constructed types, so Raven generics interoperate seamlessly with existing
.NET APIs. When a type argument itself is generic, nest the constructions as
needed (`Dictionary<string, List<int>>`).

Type parameters support constraints using the `:` syntax. After the colon,
specify `class`, `struct`, and/or nominal types that the argument must derive
from or implement. Constraints are comma-separated and may appear in any order.

```raven
class Repository<TContext: class, IDisposable>
{
    init(context: TContext) { /* ... */ }
}
```

The compiler enforces the constraint set whenever the generic type is
constructed. Passing an argument that does not satisfy one of the constraints
reports an error and identifies the unmet requirement.

#### Accessibility

Types and members accept the standard access modifiers. Applying more than
one keyword produces the expected CLR combinations:

| Modifier syntax            | Meaning |
|----------------------------|---------|
| `public`                   | Visible from any assembly. |
| `internal`                 | Visible only within the current assembly. |
| `protected`                | Visible to the declaring type and to derived types. |
| `private`                  | Visible only inside the declaring type. |
| `protected internal`       | Visible to derived types or any code in the same assembly. |
| `private protected`        | Visible to derived types declared in the same assembly. |

Default accessibility depends on the declaration context:

* Top-level classes, structs, interfaces, and enums default to `internal` and
  must be marked `public` to be exposed from the assembly. Other accessibility
  keywords collapse to the same effective visibility when applied at the
  top level.
* Nested types default to `private` unless they are declared inside an
  interface, in which case they are implicitly `public`.
* Member declarations (fields, methods, properties, indexers, and constructors)
  default to `public`. Members of interfaces are always public, even when no
  modifier is written.

Constructors follow these rules as well. An explicitly declared parameterless
constructor may specify any of the modifiers above to control how instances
are created:

```raven
class Widget
{
    private init() { /* singleton helper */ }
    protected init(name: string) { /* subclass hook */ }
    protected internal init Clone(source: Widget) { /* reuse state */ }
}
```

### Primary constructors

Classes may declare a primary constructor by adding an argument list to the
type header. Each parameter is captured and stored in an implicit instance
field with the same name. The compiler synthesizes an instance constructor
whose signature matches the header parameters and assigns the arguments to
those fields before any other field initializers execute. Supplying a primary
constructor suppresses the implicit parameterless constructor; callers must
provide the declared arguments.

```raven
class Person(name: string, age: int)
{
    public GetName() -> string => name
    public GetAge() -> int => age
}

let person = Person("Ada", 42)
let years = person.GetAge()
```

### Properties

Property declarations expose a value through accessor methods rather than by
directly exposing a field. A property appears inside a class or struct and must
declare a name, type, and one or more accessors:

```raven
public Value: int {
    get {
        return _value
    }

    set {
        _value = value
    }
}
```

The compiler synthesizes accessor methods named `get_<PropertyName>` and
`set_<PropertyName>`. Setters receive an implicit parameter named `value` whose
type matches the property type. The `static` modifier may be applied to the
property declaration to associate both accessors with the containing type.

#### Accessor bodies

Accessors may use block bodies or expression bodies. A property declaration may
also collapse to a single expression-bodied member; it is shorthand for a `get`
accessor with the same expression body.

```raven
public Value: int => _value

public Value: int {
    get => _value
    private set => _value = value
}
```

#### Auto-implemented properties

When every accessor in a class or struct property omits both a block body and an
expression body, the property is treated as **auto-implemented**. The compiler
generates a hidden backing field of the same type and emits trivial accessor
bodies that read from and write to that field. Auto-properties respect the
property's modifiers: a `static` auto-property produces a static backing field,
and accessor-level accessibility (for example `private set`) controls exposure
without affecting code generation.

Any accessor may be omitted. A property with only `get` remains read-only and
exposes the default value of its backing field until assigned from within the
type (e.g., via a constructor calling another accessor). Auto-properties are not
available on interfaces, where accessors remain abstract.

### Class inheritance

Classes are sealed by default. Marking a class `open` allows it to be used as a base type. This explicit opt-in keeps instantiable
classes from being inherited accidentally‚Äîthe class author must deliberately allow derivation before clients can extend it. The
`abstract` modifier also enables inheritance: abstract classes are implicitly open and may serve as base types without the `open`
keyword. Raven also supports
**sealed hierarchies** in the style of Kotlin and modern Java. Applying the `sealed` modifier to a class keeps the hierarchy
closed to a known set of subclasses declared in the same source file (including nested types). The compiler treats those
subclasses as the exhaustive set for purposes such as pattern-matching analysis.

> **Note:** Raven's `sealed` keyword follows Kotlin and Java's terminology rather than C#'s. In C#, `sealed` means "cannot be
> inherited". In Raven that concept is already the default. The `sealed` modifier instead designates a hierarchy whose direct
> subclasses are known at compile time.

A base class is specified with a colon followed by the type name:

```raven
open class Parent {}
class Child : Parent {}
```

If the base list contains additional types after the base class, each of those entries must be an interface that the class implem
ents. When no base class is provided, the compiler implicitly uses `object` and treats the first entry as an interface instead:

```raven
class Worker : IDisposable, ILogger
{
    Dispose() -> () { /* ... */ }
    Log(message: string) -> () { /* ... */ }
}
```

Implementations are matched by name, parameter count, and `ref`/`out` modifiers. Each successfully matched member is emitted as a
final override so the CLR records the implementation in the type's interface map. See [Interfaces](#interfaces) for interface decl
aration rules and inheritance.

If a derived class omits a constructor, the base class' parameterless constructor is invoked automatically. Access modifiers
(`public`, `internal`, `protected`, `private`) apply as usual; `protected` members are accessible to derived classes. An
instance constructor may chain to a specific base overload by adding a constructor initializer between its parameter list and
body:

```raven
open class Base { public init(value: int) {} }

class Derived : Base {
    public init(value: int): base(value) {
        // The base invocation runs before the derived body executes.
    }
}
```

The initializer is only available on ordinary instance constructors. Static constructors report `RAV0312`, and named
constructors continue to behave as user-defined factories without chaining.

> **Limitations:** Only single inheritance is supported.

### Partial classes

Applying the `partial` modifier to a class declaration allows the type to be defined across multiple declarations in the same
assembly. All declarations must use the `partial` modifier; omitting it on any declaration produces a diagnostic and prevents the
declarations from merging. When two declarations with the same name and containing scope appear without `partial`, the compiler
reports a duplicate-type diagnostic.

Partial declarations combine their members and share a single type identity. Modifiers, accessibility, and the base list are
interpreted as a whole‚ÄîRaven currently resolves the base class, implemented interfaces, and type parameters from the first
declaration it processes, so later declarations should match or omit those clauses. Apart from these shared attributes, each
partial declaration may contribute additional members, and the aggregate behaves exactly like a class declared in one piece.

### Method overloading

Functions and methods may share a name as long as their parameter counts or
types differ. Overload resolution selects the best match based on argument
types, `out`/by-ref modifiers, and nullability. Ambiguous calls produce a
diagnostic.

```raven
class Printer
{
    public Print(x: int) -> () => Console.WriteLine(x)
    public Print(x: string) -> () => Console.WriteLine(x)
}

Print(42)
Print("hi")
```

### Invocation operator

Declaring a method named `self` makes instances of the type invocable with the
call operator `()`. 

```raven
class Adder
{
    public self(x: int, y: int) -> int => x + y
}

let add = Adder()
let sum = add(1, 2) // calls self(1, 2)
```

Invocation operators can themselves be overloaded by providing multiple `self`
methods with different parameter signatures.

## Interfaces

`interface` declarations describe a contract that other types may implement. Interfaces are reference types; they emit as abstrac
t CLR interfaces and cannot be instantiated directly.

```raven
interface ILogger
{
    Log(message: string) -> ()
}
```

Interfaces may be declared at the top level, inside namespaces, or nested inside other types. Like classes, they support the same set of member declarations (methods, properties, indexers, and nested types).
Instance members are abstract requirements by default, but supplying a body for a method or accessor turns it into a default implementation emitted directly on the interface.
Static members, by contrast, must provide a body and emit as real static members on the interface type; implementing types never participate in their implementation or override process.
When an interface member uses accessors, a bare `;` accessor denotes an unimplemented accessor requirement (`get;`/`set;`).

### Base interfaces

An interface may inherit from other interfaces by listing them after a colon. The compiler resolves each entry to an interface ty
pe and records the relationship so `AllInterfaces` exposes the full transitive closure. Non-interface types are ignored.

```raven
interface IAsyncLogger : ILogger, IDisposable {}
```

### Implementing interfaces

Classes and structs implement interfaces by listing them in their base list. The optional class base (if any) must appear first,
followed by one or more interfaces. Implementing types must provide members whose signatures match every required interface memb
er‚Äîname, parameter count, parameter types (including by-reference modifiers), and return type must align. Raven records the match
ing methods as final overrides and emits the necessary `InterfaceImpl` metadata so the CLR recognises the implementation.

```raven
class FileLogger : ILogger, IDisposable
{
    public Dispose() -> () { /* release resources */ }

    public Log(message: string) -> ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(message)
    }
}
```

An **explicit interface implementation** qualifies the member name with the interface type: `ILogger.Log`. Explicit members are
always instance members, ignore `virtual`/`override` modifiers, and are not accessible through the implementing type by name; callers must reference the containing interface. The compiler emits these methods with metadata names like `Namespace.ILogger.Log` and wires them directly into the interface map.

```raven
class QuietLogger : ILogger
{
    string ILogger.Log(message: string) -> string
    {
        return "[quiet]"
    }
}
```

```
let logger = QuietLogger()
logger.Log("hi")              // error: member not found
(logger :> ILogger).Log("hi") // ok
```

If a type lists only interfaces, the compiler still emits `System.Object` as the base type before attaching the interface impleme
ntations.

## Operators (precedence summary)

Lowest ‚Üí highest (all left-associative unless noted):

1. Assignment: `=  +=  -=  *=  /=  %=`
2. Null-coalescing: `??`
3. Logical OR: `||`
4. Logical AND: `&&`
5. Equality: `==  !=`
6. Relational: `<  >  <=  >=`
7. Type tests: `is  as` (binds after relational)
8. Additive: `+  -`
9. Multiplicative: `*  /  %`
10. Cast: `(T)expr`
11. Unary (prefix): `+  -  !  typeof`
12. Postfix trailers: call `()`, member `.`, index `[]`

> **Disambiguation notes**
>
> * `(<expr>)` is a **parenthesized expression** unless a comma appears (including trailing), in which case it‚Äôs a **tuple**.
> * `<` starts **type arguments** only in a **type context**; elsewhere it‚Äôs the less-than operator.
> * The LHS of assignment must be **assignable** (identifier, member access, element access, or tuple deconstruction).

## Outstanding questions and suggested follow-ups

The current implementation leaves a few behaviours underspecified. The following
items capture those gaps and outline the preferred direction for addressing them:

- **`if` expressions without `else` in value contexts.** The compiler currently
  allows `let x = if cond { 1 }` even though the false branch does not yield a
  value, which in turn produces incomplete IL. Either require an `else` branch
  when the result is consumed or implicitly supply `()` for the missing branch.
  Both options should be accompanied by diagnostics that guide authors toward
  the intended usage.
- **Element type discovery for `for` loops.** Non-array collections default the
  iteration variable to `object`, losing type information. Extend binding to
  inspect `IEnumerable<T>`/`IAsyncEnumerable<T>` or the enumerator pattern so the
  loop variable reflects the element type instead of falling back to `object`.
