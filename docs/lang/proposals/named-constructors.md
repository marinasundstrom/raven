# Proposal: Named constructors

> ⚠️ 🧩 This proposal has been partly implemented

This document outlines the feature "named constructors".

## Purpose

To provide a way to give semantics to object creation and to allow for behaviors not available on ordinary constructors.

## Syntax

The syntax for declaring a named constructor is similar to an ordinary constructor, but in addition to `init` there is an identifier holding the name of the construct:

```raven
public class Person {
    private let name

    public init WithName(name: string) {
        self.name = name
    }
}
```

Notice that `self` is available within the named constructor.

The named constructor is utilized like so:

```raven
let person = Person.WithName("John")
```

You could then additionally call methods on the resulting object in a way that makes code flow.

```raven
let person = Person
    .WithName("John")
    .WithAge(42)
```

### Implementation details

Implementation-wise, named constructors are static factory methods that are defined like so in C#:

```csharp
public class Person 
{
    private string name;

    public static string WithName(string name) 
    {
        var self = new Person();
        self.name = name;
        return self;
    }
}
```

Notice that the static factory method, which is the named constructor, has access to the private members of the instance in "self" since its defined within the same class.

The method is utilized like so from C# and other .NET languages:

```csharp
var person = Person.WithName("John");
```

This sample demonstrated how to use a named constructor from C#.

## Points

* Gives semantics to object creation.
* Has access to `self`.
* Behave like methods.

## Notes

* Named constructors are like methods, because they are, so they can be `async`. But semantically, you might go for static methods when `self` is not appropriate.
