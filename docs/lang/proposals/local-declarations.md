> ‚ö†Ô∏è üß© This proposal has been partly implemented

## Anatomy

There is the identifier and the bound expression.

## ``let`` vs ``var`` declarations

Explanation:

* ``let`` is a name whose value can't be changed, but overridden.

* ``var`` is a variable in its true sense. It's value may change.

## Type inferences

If a local doesn't have an annotation then its type will be inferred from the bound expression.

This is part of a bigger feature.
