# Influences

## C#

## F#

Functional programming language in the ML language family. Based on OCaml, it marries functional programming paradigm with .NET.

## Kotlin

General-purpose programming language primarily on the Java Platform. Influence by C# and many other languages. Explicit mutable and immutable bindings.

## Swift

## Rust

A systems programming language with an explicit memory management model based on borrowing. Bindings are immutable by default. Errors are explicitly handled. (or ignored)

## Beef

A systems programming language intended for game programming that borrows a lot from C# and .NET when it comes to syntax and standard library. It's meant to be as powerful as C/C++ in memory management, but C# devs will be comfortable. It also adds features from other languages, such as discriminate unions and error handling in a way similar to in Rust.
