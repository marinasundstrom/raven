# General compiler fixes extracted from the neoCLR experiment

2026-09-14. Branch `codex/compiler-fixes-integration`, based on upstream main
`d92b02812740ae052f277c23151e9cc208f7672d`. The experimental target branch remains
separate. This branch does not add neoCLR target selection, array invariance,
Void-as-a-generic-argument policy or runtime protocol renaming.

## Reviewed batches

| Batch | Original experiment commits | Ordinary .NET evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Numeric operations, operator applicability and pointer substitution | `26907410f`, `c1431bea1`, `406962312`, `09cf60417`, `bc0ec8046`, `809aef0fe`, `e51da7a48` | 122 selected tests: 12 failures before applying compiler fixes; all pass afterwards. |
| Binding, dispatch, receivers, enum context and constructor completion | `a843844e4`, `6ab473fbc`, `9b269f9d0`, `62105de24`, `3142f2f13`, `55c0f7ef5`, `854cd4d3d` | 32 selected tests: nine failures before this batch; all pass afterwards. |

Changes and relevant specs were applied individually; this is not a merge of the
experimental branch. Tests for interface flags, imported indexers and expression
receivers were separated from target-specific fixtures. The method-group regression
was extracted without bringing in an unrelated explicit-Void delegate test.

The checks cover observable CLR execution, metadata flags, conversion classification,
invalid operator operands, inherited-interface ambiguity and ordinary semantic-model
completion. They do not establish that every changed path independently failed before
its fix. No emitted-opcode sequence assertions were introduced.

The fresh worktree ran `scripts/codex-build.sh`. Initial focused tests built their
project references; subsequent focused tests reused those foundational library builds
and rebuilt the compiler/test assemblies as needed. Host SDK:
`11.0.100-rc.1.26425.128`; focused execution target: `net11.0`.
After both batches, `scripts/test-baseline.sh` completed successfully: 5,489
passed, no failures or skips (including its compiler, editor and supporting test
projects). The focused execution checks above cover the changed runtime paths.
This is not a full Raven release gate or validation of NanoFramework. The branch
is prepared for review; this record does not claim it has been merged into main.

The language specifications updated with the fixes cite the C# numeric-conversion
and operator-applicability baselines. These corrections restore ordinary .NET
behavior; the experiment discovered them but does not own their semantics.

## Main integration directive — 2026-09-14

The author directed that fixes benefiting Raven generally belong on Raven main,
while experimental neoCLR support stays on a separate feature branch. This is the
workflow for future fixes too: extract and validate general behavior independently;
do not merge the experimental branch wholesale.

The namespace fixes from `f80902d70` were extracted onto this main-based integration
branch. The regression was rewritten with ordinary .NET framework references and
default compilation options, removing its dependency on experimental MetadataImportOptions.
It failed on imported-member completion before the fix. Metadata-first marker lookup
also uses the existing general reference-type resolver; no new target option is added.
The original numeric/binding batches remain unchanged.

General cross-target emission candidates listed in neoCLR's assessment still require
individual dependency review and ordinary-target evidence. They are not classified as
permanently experimental merely because neoCLR discovered them. Iteration/propagation
renaming, alternative array semantics and inhabited Void remain on the experiment
branch until separately designed and approved for Raven's general target model.

Main-integration validation: 47 focused namespace tests passed, followed by
`scripts/test-baseline.sh`: 5,490 passed, zero failures/skips. The latter includes the
new default-options namespace regression. The prior numeric and binding runtime
checks remain the evidence for those unchanged batches. This is source integration,
not a Raven release or NanoFramework certification.

## Pointer metadata emission — 2026-09-14

Extracted the pointer reconstruction fix from `3df1b54b0` on the main-based
`codex/general-pointer-emission` branch. The original default-options test already
passed on main, so it was extended to exercise the existing EmitOptions target-core
contract as well. That case failed with an unsupported `Unit*` metadata type before
the fix (six other normalizer checks passed). The change recursively preserves
pointer element types during method-reference reconstruction. It introduces no
experimental metadata import options or neoCLR-specific type semantics.

Validation: all 53 focused normalizer, pointer code-generation, pointer semantic
and pointer syntax checks passed. The compiler build and whitespace formatting
completed. This scoped check is not a new full release gate.
