# Design Goals

- **Architecture Inspired by the C# Compiler**: Build the compiler using the proven architecture of the C# compiler as a foundation.

- **Familiar Yet Unique API**: Design an API that closely mirrors the structure and functionality of Roslynâ€™s API, while embracing differences necessary for a fresh start and focusing on a single language.
