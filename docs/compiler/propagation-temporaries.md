# Propagation temporary lifetime

When a propagation operand has no exception-conversion boundary, lowering binds
its temporary at initialization. In `(await operation)?`, this prevents an empty
carrier from being hoisted before the await has produced it. Operands requiring
exception conversion retain their declaration outside the protected assignment.
No option or precedence changes: `await operation?` applies postfix propagation
before await. The regression executes pending success and completed failure on
ordinary .NET Task; focused protected-await tests validate exception behavior.
