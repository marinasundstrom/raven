# Iterator binding notes

This note captures the current binder output for iterator methods prior to any lowering work. The goal is to have a documented baseline before rewriting iterators into state machines.

## Iterator method metadata

`BlockBinder.ResolveIteratorInfoForCurrentMethod` is responsible for computing iterator metadata based on the enclosing method's return type and, when successful, calling `SourceMethodSymbol.MarkIterator`. However, the current binder never resolves a non-`None` iterator kind for either `IEnumerable<T>` or `IEnumerator<T>` return types, so `SourceMethodSymbol.IsIterator` remains `false` and `IteratorElementType` stays `null`. This is observable through the semantic model: both iterator samples expose `IteratorKind.None`, and no element type is recorded. 【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Binder/BlockBinder.Statements.cs†L331-L361】【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Binder/BlockBinder.Statements.cs†L569-L618】【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Symbols/Source/SourceMethodSymbol.cs†L146-L160】【F:test/Raven.CodeAnalysis.Tests/Semantics/IteratorBindingTests.cs†L26-L109】

## Bound nodes for `yield`

`yield return` binds to `BoundYieldReturnStatement` and `yield break` to `BoundYieldBreakStatement`. Both nodes carry an `IteratorKind` slot, but because `ResolveIteratorInfoForCurrentMethod` returns `IteratorKind.None`, that slot currently remains `None` and the element type defaults to the compilation error type. The new semantic tests illustrate this behavior for both `IEnumerable<T>` and `IEnumerator<T>` return types, establishing the baseline that lowering must account for (and likely fix). 【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Binder/BlockBinder.Statements.cs†L322-L354】【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Binder/BlockBinder.Statements.cs†L355-L367】【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/BoundTree/BoundYieldReturnStatement.cs†L7-L18】【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/BoundTree/BoundYieldBreakStatement.cs†L5-L14】【F:test/Raven.CodeAnalysis.Tests/Semantics/IteratorBindingTests.cs†L26-L109】

## Lowering entry point status

Iterator detection now runs ahead of the general lowering pipeline. `Lowerer.LowerBlock` and `Lowerer.LowerStatement` call a helper that checks whether the containing symbol is a `SourceMethodSymbol` and whether the bound block actually contains `yield` statements. Only then will `IteratorLowerer.Rewrite` be invoked, which currently returns the original block unchanged. This keeps lambda lowering untouched while paving the way for the real iterator transform. 【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/BoundTree/Lowering/Lowerer.cs†L22-L37】【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/BoundTree/Lowering/Lowerer.Iterators.cs†L7-L16】【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/BoundTree/Lowering/IteratorLowerer.cs†L9-L66】

## Synthesized state machine shape

`IteratorLowerer.Rewrite` now assigns iterator metadata and produces a synthesized enumerator type for each yielding method. The helper infers the iterator kind and element type from the method's return signature, marks the method as an iterator, and asks the compilation to create the state machine. The synthesized type captures the method's state (`_state`), the current element (`_current`), the instance receiver when needed, and one field per method parameter. It also wires up the relevant enumerable/enumerator interfaces so code generation can recognize the shape later. These synthesized types are tracked on both the method symbol and the compilation so downstream phases can emit them. 【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/BoundTree/Lowering/IteratorLowerer.cs†L23-L56】【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Symbols/Source/SourceMethodSymbol.cs†L36-L43】【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Symbols/Source/SourceMethodSymbol.cs†L118-L133】【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Symbols/Synthesized/SynthesizedIteratorTypeSymbol.cs†L7-L190】【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Compilation.cs†L22-L35】【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Compilation.cs†L314-L332】

## MoveNext body generation

Iterator lowering now synthesizes the `MoveNext` method immediately after building the state machine shell. The builder allocates numeric states, emits an entry dispatch that jumps to the appropriate resumption label, and rewrites each `yield return` into assignments to `_current` and `_state` followed by `return true`. `yield break` is rewritten into a `_state = -1` assignment and `return false`, and a final fall-through writes `_state = -1` before returning `false` when the iterator completes. The resulting bound block is stored on the synthesized type so later phases can consume it. 【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/BoundTree/Lowering/IteratorLowerer.cs†L48-L260】【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Symbols/Synthesized/SynthesizedIteratorTypeSymbol.cs†L45-L162】

New semantic tests assert the generated structure (state dispatch, entry label, resume labels, and final return paths) to keep future iterations honest. 【F:test/Raven.CodeAnalysis.Tests/Semantics/IteratorLowererTests.cs†L120-L179】

## State machine surface and rewritten iterator body

Iterator lowering now fills out the enumerator surface and rewrites the original iterator method. The synthesized type exposes a constructor, typed and untyped `Current` properties, `Dispose`, `Reset`, and (for enumerable iterators) both generic and non-generic `GetEnumerator` methods. The iterator method body is replaced with a block that allocates the state machine, copies `this` and parameters into their fields, seeds the initial state, and returns the instance cast to the declared return type. 【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Symbols/Synthesized/SynthesizedIteratorTypeSymbol.cs†L15-L257】【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/BoundTree/Lowering/IteratorLowerer.cs†L37-L126】

Tests cover the synthesized members and validate the rewritten block shape for instance and static iterators. 【F:test/Raven.CodeAnalysis.Tests/Semantics/IteratorLowererTests.cs†L40-L211】

## Helper member bodies

Iterator lowering now builds bound bodies for the remaining synthesized members on the iterator state machine. The typed `Current` getter returns the `_current` field, the non-generic getter casts it to `object`, and `Dispose` stamps `_state = -1` before returning. `Reset` throws a `NotSupportedException`, the generic `GetEnumerator` resets the state to 0 and returns `this`, and the explicit non-generic `GetEnumerator` funnels through the generic implementation. These bodies are cached alongside `MoveNext` on the synthesized type for use during code generation. 【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/BoundTree/Lowering/IteratorLowerer.cs†L66-L189】【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/Symbols/Synthesized/SynthesizedIteratorTypeSymbol.cs†L90-L170】【F:test/Raven.CodeAnalysis.Tests/Semantics/IteratorLowererTests.cs†L213-L304】

## Code generation integration

The backend now recognizes iterator state machines alongside other synthesized types. Code generation registers `SynthesizedIteratorTypeSymbol` instances so `TypeGenerator` can emit builders for nested enumerator classes even though they lack syntax. `MethodBodyGenerator` consumes the cached bound bodies produced during lowering—emitting IL for `MoveNext`, the helper accessors, and the rewritten iterator method—while synthesized constructors chain to `object..ctor`. A targeted codegen test verifies that emitting an iterator produces a state machine implementing both generic enumerable and enumerator interfaces with the expected members. 【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/CodeGen/CodeGenerator.cs†L609-L640】【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/CodeGen/TypeGenerator.cs†L68-L137】【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/CodeGen/MethodBodyGenerator.cs†L57-L128】【F:test/Raven.CodeAnalysis.Tests/CodeGen/CodeGeneratorTests.cs†L149-L201】

## Next step

Backend emission is wired up, so the remaining gap is end-to-end validation. The next step is to add runtime coverage that builds and executes iterator-heavy programs—`samples/generator.rav`, lambdas that close over `yield`, and the LINQ sample—to ensure the synthesized state machines behave correctly and that pre-existing lowering (especially lambdas) keeps working. These should live in an integration-style harness that drives the compiler, runs the produced assembly, and asserts observable behavior. Update these notes once those integration tests land and document any follow-on issues they reveal. 【F:src/Raven.CodeAnalysis/BoundTree/Lowering/IteratorLowerer.cs†L37-L189】
