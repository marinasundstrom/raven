// BUG:
// It seems like the spread operation emit fails for user-defined type (Item) in collection. 
// Most likely because they are in separate universes. Loads collection types from Private lib when binding spread operation. 
// And the operation fails on: GetConstructor, line 1029 in ConstructedNamedTypeSymbol.cs.
