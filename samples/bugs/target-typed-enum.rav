// BUG:
// I couldn’t get target-typed enums to work when passing them to the constructor. 
// I think we need to refactor so target-types apply equally for both methods invocations and new constructors invocations. Re-use and Simplify paths.

let item = foo(.A) // Works
let item = Item(.A) // Don't work

func foo(value: Value) {}

class Item(value: Value) { }

enum Value { A, B }
