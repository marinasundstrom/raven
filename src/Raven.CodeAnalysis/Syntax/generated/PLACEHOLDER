This directory will contain generated files. These files won't be checked into the repository. Editing these files will cause the compiler to act in unexpected ways. If  Model.yml changes these files will be re-generated. 

To manually trigger generation of these files, run this command from the "Syntax" directory:

dotnet run --project  ../../tools/NodeGenerator

Add -f to force even if the model has no changed.
